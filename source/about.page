Hey, I'm Khoa. Welcome to my personal page and blog and stuff, where I put 
my interest, my thought and whatever I can think of. Well, being a developer 
means that most of the posts will be related to programming, however I do hope 
there shall be more interesting posts flying around the corner.

If you found the name **tkhoa2711** somewhere on the Internet, that's probably 
me. I have been using this nickname since I first got to know typing the web 
address into the address bar of IE6. That's what we call "surfing the web", 
aren't we?

## Talk to me!

You can contact me by email ``_my_nickname_ a. yahoo.com.vn``. 
My very first email registered 10 years ago.

I'm also on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/tkhoa2711) and 
[GitHub](http://github.com/tkhoa2711).
